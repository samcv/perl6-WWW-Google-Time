# DESCRIPTION

This module lets you find out the current time in various locations around
the globe using Google.

# EXPORTED SUBROUTINES

## `google-time-in`

```perl6
    my %time = google-time-in 'Toronto';
```

Uses Google to fetch time for specified location. Will
[fail](http://docs.perl6.org/routine/fail) if a network
error occurs or if the location cannot be found. On success, returns a hash
with the following keys:

### `where`

```perl6
    # Location: Toronto, ON
    say "Location: %time<where>"
```
The location for which the time data is provided. Note this might be slightly
different from the original location you provided to `google-time-in`.

### `time`

```perl6
    # Time: 9:31 AM
    say "Time: %time<time>"
```
The current time in `AM`/`PM` format.

### `tz`

```perl6
    # Time zone: EST
    say "Time zone: %time<tz>"
```
The time zone.

### `week-day`

```perl6
    # Day of the week: Monday
    say "Day of the week: %time<week-day>"
```

### `month`

```perl6
    #  Month: December
    say "Month: %time<month>"
```
The name of the month.

### `month-day`

```perl6
    #  Day of the month: 7
    say "Day of the month: %time<month-day>"
```
The day of the month (1â€“31).

### `year`

```perl6
    # Year: 2015
    say "Year: %time<year>"
```
The year.

### `str`

```perl6
    # Full time string: 9:31 AM EST, Monday, December 7, 2015
    say "Full time string: %time<str>"
```
Convenience key that combines most of the above keys into a single
human-readable string.

### `DateTime`

```perl6
    # DateTime object:  2016-12-22T09:31:48.651773-05:00
    say "DateTime object:  %time<DateTime>";
```

Contains a [`DateTime`](https://docs.perl6.org/type/DateTime) object,
representing the time. Since seconds are not available from Google, the seconds
in the object are set via `59.999 min DateTime.now.utc.second` and thus depend
on the local time of the machine the code is running on.

*Note*: the timezone offset is derived from a hardcoded map of timezone
abbreviation-to-offset and if the abbreviation cannot be decoded, offset of
0 is used. I have no guarantees that map includes every possible timezone
abbreviation Google may return.
